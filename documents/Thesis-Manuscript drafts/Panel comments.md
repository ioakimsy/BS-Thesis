Comments from the Panel:

1. Update labels in the figures to reflect the ones used in the presentations.
2. S30: Change to base 2 (instead of base 10) => Personally (adviser) preferred for low values.
3. Change y-axis to the same range.
4. ~~Page 9 check missing.~~
5. Separate chapter cases: homogenous case.
    1. Overarching model for the first few chapter.
	2. Changes in the model per chapter.
6. ~~Discuss the difference from the graduation of learning rates (multiple, vs binary).~~
7. ~~Indicate the number of independent trials (random realizations) are used to estimate the averages and the uncertainties.~~
8. ~~S11: Ensure the explanation for positional learning factor is clear in the manuscript. Discuss possible $\rho$-effect in the traditional instruction.~~
9. S16: 
	1. ~~Discuss the possible effects of nearest neighbor (e.g. 1st and second Moore, etc).~~
	2. Discuss how to account for misconception.
10. S03: ~~Ensure that the manuscript emphasizes that the simulation model focuses on the Peer Discussion only and does not involve the learning process during the lecture portion.~~
	1. ~~Discuss the difference if the full spectrum of steps in the PI is used. Discuss why it’s better than either model cases considered.~~
	2. ~~Discuss the reason why N=4 for PI (as seed “learned” states resulting from initial instructions).~~
11. Explain how the formula are derived from the physical setup and assumptions of the model.
12. Explain the utility of powerlaw in the explanation.
	1. ~~Why use powerlaw?~~
	2. Implications. Ensure explanation in the manuscript.
	3. ~~Discuss why m≈2.~~
13. ~~S29: Clarify the meaning of “wave of learning” and “shape of the wave”. Discuss in relation to the image/figure as explained here. Update the manuscript with the figures used in the defense.~~
14. ~~Use “learning efficiency” instead of “better performance” in relation to class learning rate and time to learn. Use in the conclusion and text.~~
15. ~~S28: Two-stage learning. Ensure clear explanation in the manuscript. Point out in the cumulative plot. The required fitting function may be combination. Explain this.~~
16. Simulation time estimates.
17. Ensure all figures have explanation within the caption and in the text. Use figures in some explanation in the text / manuscript.
